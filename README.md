Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. This repository contains a web-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking X or O in empty squares, and the objective is to have three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
